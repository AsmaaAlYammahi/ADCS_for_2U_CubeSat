# ADCS_for_2U_CubeSat
Attitude Determination and Control System for (2U) CubeSats using TRIAD Algorithm and PD controller 

The system is divided into two SIMULINK Blocks 
  1. Attitude Control System
        -   Using 3 (orthogonal- RWS) developed "in-house" by using commercial off the shelf BLDC motor and 3-d printed Flywheel
        -   Quaternino based PD Controller 


  2. Attitude Control System 
        -   using TRIAD Algirthm 
        -   ECI AND BRF frame 
        -   Parameterized by quaternion

Further Enhancement to this module will be focused on the connecting of both systems to work simutaniously. 
All constant used are random Trial and Error data
